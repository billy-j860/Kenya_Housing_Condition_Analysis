# Kenya_Housing_Condition_Analysis
Analysing housing condition in a Kenyan town: SQL and Power Bi insights
## Overview of housing conditions in Kenya
The estimated Kenyan population as per National Census 2019 is approximately 55 million, this is over an area of approximately 582,000 square kms. Consequently the country has been grappling adequate and standard housing for the growing population. This creates a deficiency in housing conditions, that instead of the 250,000 housing units needed to cater for the population only 50000 standard units are met. Leading issues with this housing problem is informal settlements predominant in urban areas, and poor quality houses, basic services and tenure security in rural set up.
## Objectives
Therefore the objectives for this project are four
  1. To assess the overall quality of housing in Kenya based on multiple factors
  2. To identify key determinants of housing quality
  3. To analyze regional variations in housing conditions (Rural Vs. Urban)
  4. To explore relationships between housing quality and socio-economic factors
## Dataset and tools
The dataset can be accessed via Financial Sector Deepening Kenya (FSD Kenya): https://www.fsdkenya.org/research-and-publications/datasets/kenya-financial-diaries-2012-2013-socio-economic-and-demographic-datasets/
### Tools Used
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for data manipulation and analysis
- Power BI for data visualization and dashboard creation
## Methodology
  1. Data cleaning and preparation using SQL
  2. Creation of a composite housing quality index
  3. Statistical analysis of factors influencing housing quality
  4. Visualization of findings using Power BI
## Key Variables
- Building materials (walls, roof, floor)
- Access to utilities (water, electricity, sanitation)
- Housing type and size
- Environmental factors
- Ownership status
## Project Structure
- `/sql_queries`: SQL scripts for data analysis
- `/powerbi_reports`: Power BI report files
- `/data`: Information about the dataset (Note: Actual data files are not included due to privacy concerns)
- `/docs`: Additional documentation and findings
## Key Insights
### Analysis (69.28% Rural, 29.69% Urban):
- Reflects Kenya's ongoing urbanization challenges
- Aligns with national rural-urban migration patterns
- Shows continued rural population dominance
- Similar to Kenya's current demographic where majority still live in rural areas
### Access to Basic Amenties (17.06%)
Critical Infrastructure Gaps:
- Low access rate reflects national infrastructure challenges
- Mirrors Kenya's utility access challenges especially in rural areas
- Aligns with current government focus on:
  * Last Mile Connectivity Program (electricity)
  * Rural Electrification Program
  * Water and Sanitation Projects
### Housing Conditions
Maintenance Patterns:
- Good condition of majority houses reflects:
  * Growing middle class in Kenya
  * Improved construction standards
  * Better building materials accessibility
- Maintenance needs imply:
  * Cost of living challenges
  * Income disparities
  * Need for housing policy implementation
### Regional Disparities
Urban-Rural Divide:
- Reflects current national challenges:
  * Urban areas: Better infrastructure but overcrowding
  * Rural areas: More space but limited amenities
- Highlights need for:
  * Balanced regional development
  * Rural infrastructure improvement
  * Urban planning and development
## Implication and Recomendation
Current Context:
- Aligns with Kenya Vision 2030 goals
- Supports Big Four Agenda (Affordable Housing)
- Shows areas needing intervention:
  * Rural infrastructure development
  * Urban housing quality improvement
  * Basic amenities expansion
